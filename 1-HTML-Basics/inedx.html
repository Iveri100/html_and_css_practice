		<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
		<l1><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<l1>
		<l1>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer  <li>
		<l1> took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but  </l1>
		<l1> also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.  <l1>
			 
		
		<l2>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and </l2>
		<l2>more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </l2>

		<h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>	
		<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document </li>
		<li>written in a markup language like HTML</li>
		<li>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</li>
		<li>The name *cascading* comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading **priority** scheme is predictable.</li>
